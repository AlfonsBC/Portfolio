      <description>Libraries used       Numpy Matplotlib Seaborn      Repository Link    About this Project      We utilize the numerical method Finite Differences in which we obtain the solution of a partial derivatives about the heat conduction in the solid of study. To do that, we divide the continuous domain into a discrete domain to understand the conduction of heat among the particles of the body.</description>

Polynomial Approximation of degree 3 to forecast the temperature given the month and state of Mexico, we decided the best approximation based on the principle of least squares.
Project Challenges
 Deal with large data sets of data and load it. How to make the segmentation periods of time correctly, so we can forecast the weather.</description>
